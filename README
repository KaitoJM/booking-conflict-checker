# Booking Conflict Checker – Full-Stack Laravel & Vue Skills Test

A full-stack web application built with **Vue.js** for the frontend and **Laravel 12** for the backend.  
This repository follows a monorepo structure containing both frontend and backend applications.

```bash
.
├── frontend/        # Vue.js application
├── backend/         # Laravel 12 API
└── README.md
```

## Tech Stack

Frontend

- VueJS (Composition API)
- Vite
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Pinia
- Fetch for API Calls
- Nuxt UI for UI components

Backend

- Laravel 12
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL
- Eloquent ORM
- Laravel Scheduler
- Laravel Sanctum / JWT

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 24+ / Latest Stable
- npm
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, if using Sail)

## Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

- Make sure to edit the .env file for the VITE_API_URL value

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

Environment Variables

- Create a .env file in frontend/:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## Backend Setup (Laravel 12)

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure Database

- Update .env:

```bash
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The API will be available at:

```bash
http://localhost:8000
```

Scheduled Tasks

- This project uses Laravel’s scheduler for background tasks.
- Scheduling is defined in:

```bash
routes/console.php
```

- To enable the scheduler, add this cron job on the server:

```bash
* * * * * php /path-to-project/backend/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Testing

```bash
cd backend
php artisan test
```

Authentication

- Authentication is handled on the backend
- Frontend communicates via API tokens (Bearer token)
- Protected routes require authentication

API Communication

- Frontend consumes the backend REST API
- All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`

## My thought process

- I handled the Booking Conflict checks with the use of "Check Availability" button, I hid the the submit button to create the booking and will show it when check availability is done and have no conflicts and Overlaps in result.
- On the backend, business rules are isolated from controllers to keep them thin and focused on request handling.
- On the frontend, reusable composables are used to encapsulate API logic and complex state-related behavior.

## Coding Decisions

### Backend

    - Adopted a **Service / Repository pattern** to separate database access from business logic
    - Controllers are kept lightweight and delegate logic to services
    - Used Eloquent query scopes and conditional queries for flexible filtering
    - Implemented request validation to ensure API consistency
    - Leveraged Laravel Scheduler for background and maintenance tasks
    - Make use of Pest for feature testing

### Frontend

- Used **Vue 3 Composition API** for better logic reuse and clarity
- Implemented composables for API interactions instead of overusing global state
- Avoided unnecessary state storage in Pinia when data is short-lived
- Used environment-based API configuration for flexibility across environments

---

## ✅ Implemented Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Booking creation with date and time validation
- Booking availability and conflict detection
- Detection of overlapping bookings
- Gap analysis between bookings
- Sorted booking listings by date and start time
- Secure API communication using Bearer tokens
- Backend validation and error handling
- Frontend error handling with user-friendly feedback
- Scheduled cleanup of old booking records

---

## 🚀 Added Improvements

- Introduced a **booking availability analyzer** to prevent invalid bookings
- Improved UI feedback for booking conflicts and overlaps
- Centralized API logic using composables for better reuse
